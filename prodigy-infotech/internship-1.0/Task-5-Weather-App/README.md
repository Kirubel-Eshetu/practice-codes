5️⃣ Final task from my internship program as a Web Developer.

☁️ The weather app is a webiste developed with HTML, CSS and JS. <br />
🏙️ You can insert the city of your choice to check the weather condition or use your own location to check for the weather condition of your area. 🌡️
  
The weather app displays the following informations:-

- The city with the weather conditions <br />
- Temprature in degree celicus <br />
- Description about the temprature <br />
- Humidity and <br />
- Wind speed in miles/second (m/s) <br />

You can take a look at the picture of the weather application down below :)
