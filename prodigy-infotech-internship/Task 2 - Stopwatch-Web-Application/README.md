# T2-stopwatch-web-application

Task 2 from my internship program as a web developer.
Stopwatch website application to record the time, take laps, and restart. The web app provides you with three buttons to start the timer, reset it or take laps. Once you have started the timer, you can pause it or start it to continue with the counting. You can take laps when the times is counting. Give it a try. 💁🏾‍♂
- The website is provided with a time glass on the background to remind the importance of time.

- Disclaimer⚠️: The web application is not responsive yet.

You can get the image of the website down below :)
